There are many similar plugins but this reuses maximum of Bootrap 4 styles/classes and code. In many cases it can be adjusted for your Bootsrap theme without editing CSS or with minimal efforts. 

There are two modes of usage: you can use plugin with or without external CSS (means, without BsMultiSelect.(s)css) .

1. There is a possibility to use plugin without CSS file/rules but adjusting styling parameters in javascript: this is default `useCssPatch=true` mode. 

2. If you are building your project CSS file form SASS then use `useCssPatch=false` mode and link [./scss/BsMultiSelect.scss](https://github.com/DashboardCode/BsMultiSelect/blob/master/scss/BsMultiSelect.scss) to your project. SCSS file utilize your Bootstrap theme variables.  Other use case is traditional (not involving SASS): copy static [./dist/css/BsMultiSelect.css](https://github.com/DashboardCode/BsMultiSelect/blob/master/dist/css/BsMultiSelect.css) and manually adjust it for your theme.

BsMultiSelect follows Bootstrap 4 conventions and use the same instruments (babel, sass, rollup) so pretend to represent a BS team's modern plugin's **boilerplate**.  Supports all Bootsrap component features: pre/append buttons, custom validation, [form validation](https://dashboardcode.github.io/BsMultiSelect/snippetFormValidation.html). Additionally supports [RTL](https://dashboardcode.github.io/BsMultiSelect/snippetRtl.html).

# Architecture
Instead of using BS4 Dropdown component (it is not possible since BS Dropdown requires presence of `toggle-buttons` https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/26420) the plugin uses `popper.js` (V1) directly.

Inspite of this the plugin utilize `dropdown-menu` class. Menu items contains BS4 Custom checkboxes.

Other BS4 classes were used:

* `form-control` class - it is applied to `ul` that emulates `input`

* `badge` class - selected items, each item contains BS4 `close` button

* `custom-control-input` class - each dropdown item contains BS4 custom checkboxes

It was a clear design goal to provide the MultiSelect that not require external css (use Bootstrap components only) but unfortunatly, if you do not use SCSS, this can be achived only for limited number of themes. Not all bootstrap themes varibales can be accessed from a plugin as classes, or CSS-variables, therefore we need to setup them in javascript (default `useCssPatch=true` mode). Some of those variables are:

* $input-height - we need it for DIV `form-control`'s min-height; default value is "calc(2.25rem + 2px)",

* $input-disabled-bg - we need it to "disable" DIV `form-control` - set background color; default value is "#e9ecef"

* $input-color - we need to make DIV color the same as `input` color (color of text you are typing); default value is "#495057"

* focus for `isvalid`, focus for `isinvalid` effects (mixins)

If your theme changes those variables, and you do not want to start with custom css, I highly recommend to update them on the plugin initialization:

Sample `useCssPatch=true` configuration (default values used):
````
          $("select[multiple='multiple']").bsMultiSelect({
              useCssPatch=true, // default, can be ommitted
              cssPatch: {
                // choices - dropdown menu items
                choices: {listStyleType:'none'},
                choice: 'px-md-2 px-1',  // classes!
                choice_hover: 'text-primary bg-light', 
                choiceLabel_disabled: {opacity: '.65'},
                
                // picks - panel where selected item located
                picks: {listStyleType:'none', display:'flex', flexWrap:'wrap',  height: 'auto', marginBottom: '0'},
                picks_disabled: {backgroundColor: '#e9ecef'},
                picks_focus: {borderColor: '#80bdff', boxShadow: '0 0 0 0.2rem rgba(0, 123, 255, 0.25)'},
                picks_focus_valid: {boxShadow: '0 0 0 0.2rem rgba(40, 167, 69, 0.25)'},
                picks_focus_invalid: {boxShadow: '0 0 0 0.2rem rgba(220, 53, 69, 0.25)'},
                picks_def: {minHeight: 'calc(2.25rem + 2px)'},
                picks_lg:  {minHeight: 'calc(2.875rem + 2px)'},
                picks_sm:  {minHeight: 'calc(1.8125rem + 2px)'},
                pick: {paddingLeft: '0px', lineHeight: '1.5em'},
                pickButton: {fontSize:'1.5em', lineHeight: '.9em', float : "none"},
                pickContent_disabled: {opacity: '.65'}, 

                filterInput: {border:'0px', height: 'auto', boxShadow:'none', padding:'0', margin:'0', 
                             outline:'none', backgroundColor:'transparent'}
              }
          });
````

Note 1: in `cssPatch` and `css` (discussed below) parameters you can mix styles and classes (depending on your theme available features) this way:
````
      choiceLabel_disabled: { classes: '...', styles: {...}}   
````

Note 2: when you setup `cssPatch` and `css` (discussed below) parameters in configuration as object parameter - you do not need to repeat all default values -  when `classes` replaces default `classes`, `styles` from configuraion merge default `styles` (you are able to add/replace default styles only you need).

`BsMultiSelect` handles click events friendly to your modals and popups. Important: for mouse events `preventDefault`, `stopPropagation` were not used (so your other controls always will get 'clicks' on them). BsMultiSelect remove its DOM elements (in 'option was deselected intiated by the click on "x" button' scenario) using setTimeout(..,0) - this simplifies the identification of click event's target during the bubling (bacause of element is not removing in click event loop iteration you always are able to identify that click's target belongs to BsMultiselect - and skip processing - most probably cancel popup close handler); 

For keyboard events `preventDefault` was used to 
    a) handle tab (`9`)  as autocompleate 
    b) arrows (`38`, `40`) to prevent browser still them; 
    c) enter (`13`) to prvent default button action (submit etc.)
    d) esc (`27`) to avoid "clear text on `esc`" functionlity dublication

## Manipulations with SELECT > OPTION

When data source is `select` element then when user make a selection the option's `selected` attribute is not removed or added, only `HTMLOptionElement.selected` value is setuped (this automitically doesn't add\remove `selected` attribute). If it is not enough and you need to add/remove an attribute, then you can override `setSelected` in the configuration (note: but this break [HTML Form reset](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/reset) functionality in Chrome).

````
          $('#mySelect').bsMultiSelect({
              setSelected: function(option /*element*/, value /*true|false*/){
                  if (value) 
                      option.setAttribute('selected','');
                  else  
                      option.removeAttribute('selected');
                  option.selected = value;
              }
          }); 
````

`setSelected` also can be used for validation (if return `false`) and this is discussed below.

## Dynamic Updates 

Inspite plugin subscribes to form's `reset` event listener, there are no `MutationObserver` defined inside (`BsMultiSelect` does not track properties on original `SELECT`, or js object data, on parent `FIELDSET` element, or presence of `.was-validated` on parent , or presence of `is-valid`, `is-invalid`  original `select` or substitutional configuration methods. 

If you change original `select`'s appearance after `BsMultiSelecte` was created then you will need to push changes to component with corresponded methods `UpdateIsValid`, `UpdateDisabled`, `UpdateSize`, `UpdateWasValidated`, `UpdateValidy`. Or All together with `UpdateAppearance`.

If you change options/items properties (text, `selected`, `disabled`, `hidden`) or if you delete them or insert new items you need to push changes to component with  `UpdateData`. There is specific `UpdateOptionsSelected` method synchronize only `selected` states of options, `UpdateOptionsDisabled` to synchronize only `disabled` states of options, `UpdateOptionsHidden` for `hidden`.

`Update` method works like "update all": it call `UpdateAppearance` and `UpdateData`.

Samples:

````
          $('#mySelect').bsMultiSelect("UpdateDisabled"); // bsMultiSelect call the method directly
````

Or this way.

````
          var bsMultiSelect = $('#mySelect').BsMultiSelect(); // BsMultiSelect return the api object
          bsMultiSelect.updateDisabled(); // ! use traditional low case first letter calling the api methods
````         

Other way to access the component's instance is using `data` :

````
          var bsMultiSelect = $('#mySelect').data('DashboardCode.BsMultiSelect');
          if (bsMultiSelect){
              // there you are sure that component is attached
          }
````         

To update specific option `UpdateOptionSelected`,`UpdateOptionDisabled`,`UpdateOptionHidden` (*Option* here without *s*) with index argument could be used:

````
          var index =15;
          bsMultiSelect.updateOptionSelected(index);
          bsMultiSelect.updateOptionDisabled(index);
          bsMultiSelect.updateOptionHidden(index);
````    

## jQuery factories

Method 1:
````
          // bsMultiSelect returns jQuery selector
          var bsMultiSelect = $('.myMultiSelect').bsMultiSelect(options); 
````

Method 2:
````
          // BsMultiSelect return the instance of MultiSelect class (or an array 
          // of them, ir selector '.myMultiSelect' returns multiple elements)
          var bsMultiSelect = $('.myMultiSelect').BsMultiSelect(options); 
````

`$.fn["bsMultiSelect"].noConflict` and `$.fn["BsMultiSelect"].noConflict` are available.

## Features

 Shortly: BsMultiSelect supports ALL Bootstrap 4 component features (append/prepend input buttons, custom validation, HTML form validation visualization with `.was-validated`). Additionally it also supports RTL (right-to-left).

**multiline**: input can grow vertically;

**right-to-left support**: search for `[dir='rtl']` on parents; [`snippet is here...`](https://dashboardcode.github.io/BsMultiSelect/snippetRtl.html) 

**SELECT disabled / readonly / FIELDSET disabled support**: although there is difference between those two attributes for `input`, the HTML 5.2 support only `disabled` for [`select`](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-html52-20171214/sec-forms.html#the-select-element) element. `Readonly` attribute on original `select` will be ignored;

**`<option disabled selected>`**: option that is `disabled` and `selected` at the same time can be deselected but can't be selected again (just as it is in HTML `select`; important note: during the form's submit HTML ignore `disabled selected` - doesn't send them; also browser's "go back" step done with autocomplete never removes `disabled` options; have it in mind or use the feature only with options passed as JavaScript object);

**`<option hidden>`**: options with `hidden` property are ... hidden. You can't deselect them either. This is exactly how HTML5.2 works, but many other plugins show hidden options;

**change event**: you can subscribe to original `select` change event;

**form reset**: integrated with HTML Form reset functionality - button type='reset' renew the selected list;  

**`<label>`**: click on the label puts focus on input and opens the dropdown;

**`<optgroup label=".." >`** grouped options will be flatten; there is no sense mixing "Browse Tree" and "Autosuggest popup" UI expirience. Even if it is possible, I consider this as true: "code that don't exist is infinitely performant and extremely easy to maintain and document." (c) Heydon Pickering;

**no flick**: optionally it is possible to add UL element (component's picks/selections/badges list) manually to HTML; then you will see less flicks during the page load 

**placeholder**: use `data-placeholder`, `data-bsmultiselect-placeholder` or configuration parameter `{placeholder:"select something.."}`

**Bootstrap custom validation .is-valid and .is-invalid**: supports Bootstrap validation behaviour as for the original `select`, that means manage border, hovered border, toggle siblings `(in)valid-feedback` or `(in)valid-tooltip` ); [`snippet is here...`](https://dashboardcode.github.io/BsMultiSelect/snippetCustomValidation.html) ;

**Suports HTML form validation**: if original select is invalid (option is required - required attribute) then BsMultiSelect informs user on submit; [`snippet is here...`](https://dashboardcode.github.io/BsMultiSelect/snippetFormValidation.html) ;

**Suports HTML form custom validation**: you can get HTMLElement *validation API* "emulation" by `multiSelect.validationApi`, then you can call `.setCustomValidity(...)` method the same as you would do it for original [`select`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation)

**Bootstrap HTML form validation visualizations with .was-validated**: supports Bbootstrap 4 styles for input elements with pseudoclasses `.was-validated :invalid` and `.was-validated :valid`; manage border, hoovered border, toggle sibling `(in)valid-feedback` or `(in)valid-tooltip` );  [`snippet is here...`](https://dashboardcode.github.io/BsMultiSelect/snippetFormValidation.html) ;

**sizes**: supports bootstrap `custom-select-lg`, `custom-select-sm` or `input-group-lg`, `input-group-sm` on original `select`

**bootstrap input-group + prepend + append support**  but you will need to setup more infromation about the dom  - to mark a container with `dashboardcode-bsmultiselect` class
````
          <div class="input-group dashboardcode-bsmultiselect"> <!-- mark the container with dashboardcode-bsmultiselect"  -->
                <div class="input-group-prepend">
                    <span class="input-group-text">:-)</span>
                </div>
                <select name="Languages" id="languages-id" class="form-control"  multiple="multiple" style="display: none;">
                    <option value="EN">English</option>
                    <option value="ES">Spanish</option>
                </select>
                <ul class="form-control"></ul> <!-- optionally but recommended: component's  picks/selections/badges list for "no flick load" -->
          </div>
            
````

**dialog and popup** works on Bootstrap dialogs and dropdowns (BS dropdowns requires to add additional click event filtering from developer to do not close popup when clicking is inside the component - usually on click the popups should be closed )

**CSS and SCSS**: you can copy BsMultiSelect.css (included to distribution) and update values manually for your theme.
Or you can use [./scss/BsMultiSelect.scss](https://github.com/DashboardCode/BsMultiSelect/blob/master/scss/BsMultiSelect.scss) copy it to your project and update reference to your custom BS variables in yout theme); these requires such configuration:

````
          $("select[multiple='multiple']").bsMultiSelect({
              useCssPatch: false // this disables style's manipulation in js; and relly only on classes
          });
            
````
Also `useCssPatch: false` allows you to go to heavy styling (and even use plugin without bootstrap 4). Those additional options are available (you see default values):


````
          $("select[multiple='multiple']").bsMultiSelect({
              useCssPatch: false,
              css : {
                  choices: 'dropdown-menu', 
                  choice_hover:  'hover',  
                  choice_selected: '', 
                  choice_disabled: '', 
                  
                  choiceCheckBox_disabled: 'disabled',
                  choiceContent: 'custom-control custom-checkbox d-flex', 
                  choiceCheckBox: 'custom-control-input', 
                  choiceLabel: 'custom-control-label justify-content-start',
                  choiceLabel_disabled: ''

                  picks: 'form-control', 
                  picks_focus: 'focus', 
                  picks_disabled: 'disabled',
                  pick_disabled: '',  
                  
                  pickFilter: '', 
                  pick: 'badge', 
                  pickContent_disabled: 'disabled', 
                  pickButton: 'close', 
                  filterInput: '',                  
                }
            });
            
````

With `css` parameter  you can change classes of generated HTML elements. Default HTML generated (for `useCssPatch: false`) looks like:


````
        <div class="dashboardcode-bsmultiselect">
          <ul class="form-control focus" style="..">
              <li class="badge"><span>California</span><button class="close">..</button></li>
              <li class="badge"><span class="disabled">Pennsylvania</span><button class="close">..</button></li>
              <li><input id=".." style=".." ..></li>
          </ul>
          <ul class="dropdown-menu" style=".." ..>
              <li class="px-2 text-primary bg-light">
                <div class="custom-control custom-checkbox">
                   <input type="checkbox" .. >
                   <label ..>Alabama</label>
                </div>
              </li>
              <li class="px-2">
                <div class="custom-control custom-checkbox">
                  <input type="checkbox" ..>
                  <label ..>Alaska</label>
                </div>
              </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
````
**without select element - intialize with js object**: in this case plugin should be initialized over `div`
````
$('div.#bsMultiSelectJson').bsMultiSelect(
            {
                options : [
                            {text:"Asia", value:"C0",hidden:false,disabled:false,selected:true},
                            {text:"Europe",value:"C1",hidden:false,disabled:false,selected:false},
                            {text:"Australia",value:"C2",hidden:false,disabled:false,selected:false},
                            {text:"America",value:"C3",hidden:false,disabled:false,selected:false},
                            {text:"Africa",value:"C4",hidden:false,disabled:false,selected:false}
                         ],
                getDisabled : () => $('#optionDisable').is(":checked"), 
                getValidity : () => null, //... or true, or false 
                // setSelected : ... if there are no selected property in option
            }
    );
````

Note: option's item should contais two required properties (text, value) - you can't ommit them. If `selected` is ommited then `setSelected` configuration method become obligated. If `setSelected` return false this cancel update "process" - this way can be achieved such goals as **"max selected"**.

### HTML Configuration

`$("#myMultiSelect").bsMultiSelect()` would work over several configurations of initial elements

Here are recommended variants: 

1. Over `<SELECT>`
````
<select id="#myMultiSelect"></select>

<!-- no flick -->
<div class="dashboardcode-bsmultiselect">
  <select id="#myMultiSelect"></select>
  <ul class="form-control" style="..." /> <!-- styles/classes should contains everithing you need for "no flick" -->
</div>

<!-- input-group -->
<div class="input-group dashboardcode-bsmultiselect">
   <div class="input-group-prepend">...</div>
   <select id="#myMultiSelect"></select>
   <ul class="form-control" style="..."/> <!-- or put it before select  -->
   <div class="input-group-append">...</div>
</div>

````

2. Over JS Object
````
<div id="#myMultiSelect"/>

<!-- no flick -->
<div id="#myMultiSelect">
  <ul class="form-control" style="..."/> <!-- styles/classes should contains everithing you need for "no flick" -->
</div>

<!-- input-group -->
<div class="input-group dashboardcode-bsmultiselect">
   <div class="input-group-prepend">...</div>
   <ul id="#myMultiSelect" class="form-control" style="..."/> <!-- required, become picks -->
   <div class="input-group-append">...</div>
</div>

````
Note: `input-group` variants are inconsistent, but you need them not too often. 

Note: `dashboardcode-bsmultiselect` class (aka *container*) is used just to limit the search in DOM selectors and it should be never used for styling or positioning; still `(in)valid-feedback` classes should be siblings of the *container*; (also *container* is a good element to setup rtl attribute, so when RTL for `BsMultiSelect` is configured through `js` configuration `isRtl` field, `BsMultiSelect` force rtl attribute on *container*).

Note: in case of `SELECT` datasource if there are no parent `dashboardcode-bsmultiselect`  then container will be created as sibling of `SELECT`, so the `SELECT` will be located outside `dashboardcode-bsmultiselect`

Note: picks (`UL`) should be direct child of `dashboardcode-bsmultiselect` .

Note: picks (`UL`) should be styled to have compleated look suitable for "no flick" e.g. `style="list-style-type: none; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; height: auto; margin-bottom: 0px; min-height: calc(2.25rem + 2px);"`:  

Note: `choices` element (dropdown menu) and `picks` element (selectrd items) are always inside `dashboardcode-bsmultiselect`.


### Proposal to Bootstrap

It would be very nice if Bootstrap could provide those SASS variables as classes :

````
.h-input{
  min-height: $input-height; // support sm and lg form-controls also
}

.bg-disabled{
   background-color: $input-disabled-bg !important;
}

.text-input{
   color: $input-color !important;
}
````
Vote there: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/26412

Note, BS allready provide classes like: `h-25`, `bg-light`, `text-primary` that make many variables available as classes so the proposal is just an improovement of theirs class system.


### Known issues
* Tested only for IE11, Chrome 66, Edge 42/17, IPhone Safari; Browser should support flexbox (IE 9 doesn't); 

* dropdown options list could be too long if your filter is weak (and items number is not configurable); there are no scroller (but you can add it).

* no 'smart tracking' of dynamic changes in options/data - after changes in data you need to call 'Update/UpdateData' method manually (this is actally not an issue, but desing decision); also you can't update concreate option (wait for `UpdateDataItem` in future versions). Detach/attach should be used if you have changed plugin styling parameters or RTL dinamically;

* no "X selected" message, or no "no result" information messages on filter's dropdown;

* no smart disabling on mobile devices (manage it manually);

* usually you still need css to patch some plugin element's styles to fix unexpected theme effects (e.g. BS close button could be made white by a dark theme,  then `.badge > close {color:black;}` fix the problem );

* memory leaks: as I see there is something like several KB memory leak on each attach/detach  (that can be ignored since as I see every jquery plugin "attach/detach" have the same effect). Memory leak is in the compiled objects, not nodes. But I can't identify its source (jquery, bootstrap utilities, my code?). If you know how to explain it: help me. Here is a quick way to experiment with attach/detach and memory snapshots: https://dashboardcode.github.io/BsMultiSelect/snippetLeaks.html ;

### Future development

Plugin is highly customizable even now, but API is not published. "Single select", "Enter Tags" or "Enter emails", "Fonts list" etc. can be developed right now with it, but I need to stabilize API before open it (also I should made "search" customizable).

Integration with floating labels (.form-floating) .

### Alternatives:

BsMultiSelect was created because at the moment when Bootstrap 4 was released all existed multiselect plugins had strange side effects. It was just simpler to try to combine several BS 4 tools together: `form-control`, `dropdown-menu`, `close` button, `badge` then trying to understand internals of mature projects. I hope now all of them supports BS4 but this list still could be interesting for some people.


* Chosen.js: https://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/ - (ver 1.8.5), strange multiple "Consider marking event handler as 'passive' to make the page more responsive" warnings to console, not integrated to bootstrap themes (30KB+10KB js+css minified);

* Select2: https://select2.org/appearance - (ver 3.5.3) strange or broken backspace handling (at least in my Chrome 66), not integrated to bootstrap theme (66KB+14KB js+css minified);

* Bootstrap multiselect: http://davidstutz.de/bootstrap-multiselect/  -  (ver. 0.9.15) BS 4 was not supported, also no SCSS, selected options looks as plain text (not as badges, no backspace key handling (67KB+1KB js+css NOT minified);

* Bootstrap-select: https://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/ - (ver. 1.12.4) BS 4 supported, but SCSS is not integrated with BS4 variables, also picks list can't be multiline (33KB+7KB js+css minified)

* Choices https://github.com/jshjohnson/Choices - not integrated to bootstrap;

For use case "search some enitities in remote data source" (this is not the same as "select the option") I highly recommend to use the 'typeahead.js' and 'bloodhound.js' combination.
